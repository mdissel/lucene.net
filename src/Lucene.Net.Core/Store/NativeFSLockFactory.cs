    /// <p>Implements <seealso cref="LockFactory"/> using native OS file
    /// locks.  Note that because this LockFactory relies on
    /// java.nio.* APIs for locking, any problems with those APIs
    /// will cause locking to fail.  Specifically, on certain NFS
    /// environments the java.nio.* locks will fail (the lock can
    /// incorrectly be double acquired) whereas {@link
    /// SimpleFSLockFactory} worked perfectly in those same
    /// environments.  For NFS based access to an index, it's
    /// recommended that you try <seealso cref="SimpleFSLockFactory"/>
    /// first and work around the one limitation that a lock file
    /// could be left when the JVM exits abnormally.</p>
    ///
    /// <p>The primary benefit of <seealso cref="NativeFSLockFactory"/> is
    /// that locks (not the lock file itsself) will be properly
    /// removed (by the OS) if the JVM has an abnormal exit.</p>
    ///
    /// <p>Note that, unlike <seealso cref="SimpleFSLockFactory"/>, the existence of
    /// leftover lock files in the filesystem is fine because the OS
    /// will free the locks held against these files even though the
    /// files still remain. Lucene will never actively remove the lock
    /// files, so although you see them, the index may not be locked.</p>
    ///
    /// <p>Special care needs to be taken if you change the locking
    /// implementation: First be certain that no writer is in fact
    /// writing to the index otherwise you can easily corrupt
    /// your index. Be sure to do the LockFactory change on all Lucene
    /// instances and clean up all leftover lock files before starting
    /// the new configuration for the first time. Different implementations
    /// can not work together!</p>
    ///
    /// <p>If you suspect that this or any other LockFactory is
    /// not working properly in your environment, you can easily
    /// test it by using <seealso cref="VerifyingLockFactory"/>, {@link
