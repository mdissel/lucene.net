    /// TaxonomyWriterCache is a relatively simple interface for a cache of
    /// category->ordinal mappings, used in TaxonomyWriter implementations (such as
    /// <seealso cref="DirectoryTaxonomyWriter"/>).
    /// <para>
    /// It basically has put() methods for adding a mapping, and get() for looking a
    /// mapping up the cache. The cache does <B>not</B> guarantee to hold everything
    /// that has been put into it, and might in fact selectively delete some of the
    /// mappings (e.g., the ones least recently used). This means that if get()
    /// returns a negative response, it does not necessarily mean that the category
    /// doesn't exist - just that it is not in the cache. The caller can only infer
    /// that the category doesn't exist if it knows the cache to be complete (because
    /// all the categories were loaded into the cache, and since then no put()
    /// returned true).
    /// </para>
    /// <para>
    /// However, if it does so, it should clear out large parts of the cache at once,
    /// because the user will typically need to work hard to recover from every cache
    /// cleanup (see <seealso cref="#put(FacetLabel, int)"/>'s return value).
    /// </para>

    /// <b>NOTE:</b> the cache may be accessed concurrently by multiple threads,
    /// therefore cache implementations should take this into consideration.
