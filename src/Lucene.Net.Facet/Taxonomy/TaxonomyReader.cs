    /// TaxonomyReader is the read-only interface with which the faceted-search
    /// library uses the taxonomy during search time.
    /// <P>
    /// A TaxonomyReader holds a list of categories. Each category has a serial
    /// number which we call an "ordinal", and a hierarchical "path" name:
    /// <UL>
    /// <LI>
    /// The ordinal is an integer that starts at 0 for the first category (which is
    /// always the root category), and grows contiguously as more categories are
    /// added; Note that once a category is added, it can never be deleted.
    /// <LI>
    /// The path is a CategoryPath object specifying the category's position in the
    /// hierarchy.
    /// </UL>
    /// <B>Notes about concurrent access to the taxonomy:</B>
    /// <P>
    /// An implementation must allow multiple readers to be active concurrently
    /// with a single writer. Readers follow so-called "point in time" semantics,
    /// i.e., a TaxonomyReader object will only see taxonomy entries which were
    /// available at the time it was created. What the writer writes is only
    /// available to (new) readers after the writer's commit() is called.
    /// <P>
    /// In faceted search, two separate indices are used: the main Lucene index,
    /// and the taxonomy. Because the main index refers to the categories listed
    /// in the taxonomy, it is important to open the taxonomy *after* opening the
    /// main index, and it is also necessary to reopen() the taxonomy after
    /// reopen()ing the main index.
    /// <P>
    /// This order is important, otherwise it would be possible for the main index
    /// to refer to a category which is not yet visible in the old snapshot of
    /// the taxonomy. Note that it is indeed fine for the the taxonomy to be opened
    /// after the main index - even a long time after. The reason is that once
    /// a category is added to the taxonomy, it can never be changed or deleted,
    /// so there is no danger that a "too new" taxonomy not being consistent with
    /// an older index.
